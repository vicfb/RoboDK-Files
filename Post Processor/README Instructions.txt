The Post Processor Send, sends the program to the robot using the "send the program to robot" on RoboDK, 
it uses the parameters on the "connect to robot" menu. 

the Post Processor Start starts the program on the robot using the "start on robot" on RoboDK, 
the parameters for the serial communication cannot be changed on the program, if there is a different
COM port it has to be changed on the Post Processor.
